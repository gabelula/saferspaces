# Introduction

We believe that harassment and abuse are significant factors in preventing our entire community of technology companies, user groups, open source projects, and other organizations and events from being truly diverse and welcoming to participation. We all deserve to have safer spaces.

In order to eliminate harassment and abuse, we educate ourselves and members of our community on the problems that exist and the steps we can take to address them, as well as creating community-specific resources and making space for discussions about these issues.

Get involved! Email sfp@stumptownsyndicate.org to find out how, or check out our upcoming events for workshops and online office hours.
