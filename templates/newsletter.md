# Introduction

We believe that harassment and abuse are significant factors in preventing our entire community of technology companies, user groups, open source projects, and other organizations and events from being truly diverse and welcoming to participation. We all deserve to have safer spaces.

We are always discussing what problems exist in our communities, and the most effective steps we can take to address them.

Get involved! Email sfp@stumptownsyndicate.org to find out how, or check out our upcoming events for workshops and online office hours.
